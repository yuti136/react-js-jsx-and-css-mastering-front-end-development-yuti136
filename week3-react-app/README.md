Overview

Live URL: https://react-js-jsx-and-css-mastering-front-end-development-oqg3410ur.vercel.app

This is a React-based front-end project built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS.
It demonstrates modern web development practices such as component-based architecture, state management with React hooks, API integration, and responsive design.

The app includes:

A navigation bar and footer for layout structure

A reusable button component with different styles

A task manager for adding, completing, and deleting tasks

A section that fetches and displays data from a public API

A theme switcher for light and dark mode

Features

Reusable Components: Navbar, Button, Footer, and Card components for better organization.

Task Manager: Allows users to add, filter, and manage tasks while saving them locally.

API Integration: Fetches and displays data dynamically from an external API.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Dark/Light Mode: Users can switch themes with a toggle button.

How It Works

When you open the app, you’ll see a navigation bar at the top and a footer at the bottom.
In the middle section, there’s a task manager where you can:

Add new tasks

Mark them as completed

Delete or filter them by status

You’ll also see data fetched from an external API displayed in a list.
The interface adjusts automatically to different screen sizes and supports both light and dark themes.
