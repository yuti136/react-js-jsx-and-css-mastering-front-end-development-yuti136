# üé® Week 3: React.js, JSX, and Tailwind CSS ‚Äì Mastering Front-End Development

## üöÄ Objective
Build a responsive React application using JSX and Tailwind CSS that demonstrates component architecture, state management, hooks usage, and API integration.

## üìÇ Tasks

### Task 1: Project Setup
- Create a new React application using Vite
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up the project structure with components, pages, and utility folders
- Configure basic routing using React Router

### Task 2: Component Architecture
- Create reusable UI components:
  - `Button` component with different variants (primary, secondary, danger)
  - `Card` component for displaying content in a boxed layout
  - `Navbar` component for site navigation
  - `Footer` component with links and copyright information
- Implement a layout component that includes the Navbar and Footer
- Use props to make components customizable and reusable

### Task 3: State Management and Hooks
- Implement a `TaskManager` component that allows users to:
  - Add new tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Delete tasks
  - Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
- Use the following hooks:
  - `useState` for managing component state
  - `useEffect` for side effects (e.g., loading saved tasks)
  - `useContext` for theme management (light/dark mode)
  - Create a custom hook (e.g., `useLocalStorage`) for persisting tasks

### Task 4: API Integration
- Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder)
- Display the fetched data in a list or grid layout
- Implement loading and error states
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling
- Create a search feature to filter the API results

### Task 5: Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Create a responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Implement a theme switcher (light/dark mode) using Tailwind's dark mode
- Use Tailwind's utility classes for layout, spacing, typography, and colors
- Create custom animations or transitions for interactive elements

## üß™ Expected Outcome
- A fully functional React application with multiple components
- Proper state management using React hooks
- API integration with loading and error handling
- Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS
- Clean, well-organized code following React best practices
